## Refactor example of Material button-toggle-template passing in more props
passing an object into the template allows us to add additional props
such as 'tooltip' text...

## add example of Material button-toggle with ng-template and subscribed FormControl
> this template lets you reuse the same look and logic from one mat-button-toggle-group
> injecting the FormControl to be attached
[angular api documentation] (https://material.angular.io/components/button-toggle/api)

```ps
ng g c components/ButtonToggleTemplateExample
```
> a note on using subscription on FormControl 
> unsubscribing is often needed, and also here from what I have found, 
> however some unsubscribing in Angular are handled internally and I'm not sure it really is needed (but I have implemented it)

- also added a dependency  to make unsubscribing easier
Read the documentation on [until-destroy](https://github.com/ngneat/until-destroy) for more options and how to.
```ps
npm install @ngneat/until-destroy
```
- also add routing

## configure ng to not add prefix "app" on generation
by default Angular creates components with prefix 'app'
although it is good praxis to prefix your own components 
to avoid conflicts with other modules it is mostly not adding value
(if you create public shared modules you should)

angular.json
```json
"projects": {
  //...
  "prefix": "",
  //...
}
```

## add application header AppHeader (mat-toolbar)
 ```ps
 ng g c AppHeader
 ```

> remember to add modules used in app.module.ts (or the module you are usings, or a separate module used for only import and export of material modules etc.)
```ts
import { MatToolbarModule } from '@angular/material/toolbar';
```
> note that if you have your ng serve running while adding new dependencies you will not see the results of them in the browser
> f ex adding material modules like here. 


## add Angular Material Design (with default theme and global Typography styles)
```ps
ng add @angular/material

The package @angular/material@13.3.2 will be installed and executed.
